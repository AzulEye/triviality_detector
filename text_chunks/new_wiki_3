Gabriel Lechuga Navarrete (March 18, 1915 â€” April 10, 1988) was an American soldier who served in World War II. He is known for attempting to prevent the crossing that started the Battle of Rapido River, which continued without him and led to 2,128 American casualties. After his military service, Navarrete worked for El Paso County Veterans Services. He is now buried at Fort Bliss National Cemetery.

Early life
Navarrete was born on March 18, 1915, in Ysleta, El Paso, Texas.[1] He completed three years of high school before joining the military.[2]

Military service
Navarrete enlisted in the United States Army through the National Guard in El Paso, Texas, on November 25, 1940.[2]

In September 1943, Navarrete was hospitalized when a bullet from a machine gun lacerated his cheek and forehead.[3]

Navarrete is most known for his service in Company E, 141st Infantry Regiment, 36th Division, during World War II. In January 1944, during the Italian campaign, he was assigned to lead a patrol across the Rapido River, gathering information about the strength of the German military and the viability of breaching its Winter Line. After being wounded in close combat, Navarrete returned to inform his division leadership that attempting to cross the river would be disastrous. General Fred L. Walker agreed with his assessment, saying, "I do not know of a single case in military history where an attempt to cross a river that is incorporated in the main line of resistance has succeeded. So I am prepared for defeat."[4] However, higher leadership, including Major General Geoffrey Keyes and Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, ordered the crossing to proceed. This led to the Battle of Rapido River from January 20 to 22, during which 155 American soldiers were killed, 1,052 wounded, and 921 captured or missing.[5]

Navarrete was discharged on August 1, 1945.[6]

After the war, in January 1946, the 36th Division Association, composed of veterans from the division, held its first meeting and called for a congressional investigation into the battle. The members of the association alleged the 36th Division's defeat was due to Clark's inexperience and poor decision-making.[7] Robert P. Patterson, the U.S. Secretary of War, released a statement that Clark exercised sound judgement during the battle, and no action was taken against Clark.[5]

Post-military career
After his military service, Navarrete worked for El Paso County Veterans Services, assisting veterans with their legal and financial needs.[9]

Death and legacy
After World War II, Gabriel Navarrete became a symbol of heroism among American soldiers of Latino descent. His bravery and sacrifice were honored posthumously, and his legacy continues to inspire future generations. In recognition of his contributions, various memorials and streets have been named after him, serving as a lasting tribute to his service. Navarrete's story also highlights the significant role that Latino soldiers played in the U.S. military, contributing to the broader struggle for civil rights and recognition within American society.[10]

Navarrete died on April 10, 1988, and was buried at Fort Bliss National Cemetery on April 14.[6]
